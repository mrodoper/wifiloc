Arch TODOs:
I might need three components:
1) Process the sources and form {mac: [lat-long]} and write them to a file- sources folder
2) Process the database to get one lat long of a mac - 
3) Processes the [mac, lat-long] to form a sparse database

Enhancements:
1) Test folder
2) Move to databases
3) AWS integration
4) Add a configuration file for the paths
